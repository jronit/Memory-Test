Memory test game created using html, css, javasript. 
This game tests your memory through an online version of your favorite childhood memory game. 

You will be presented with a set of 16 cards, and your task is to uncover all the cards and find their corresponding match.
The moment you click a card, a timer will start to track your progress. A star rating will also be updated, calculating the number 
of moves it takes you (the user) to complete the game. 

To find a pair, simply click on one card, then one its match. If they are a match, the cards will turn green. If not, the cards will 
both flip over after 2 seconds. 

On the top, there is a replay button, which allows you to restart. This will also restart the timer, moves, and star rating. 

Once you have completed the game, you will be presented with a screen detailing your stats, including total moves, star rating, and the 
total time it took you to complete the game. From this screen, you can also replay the game, or just hit cancel and admire your finished board. 

Hope you enjoy this little brain-teaser.
